### <a name="maintenance"></a>Maintenance Mode

### <a name="session"></a>Session expiration

A user session period corresponds to the period of time the user is logged in Teampass before being automatically logged out. Once time session is over, the active session of the user is closed.
The remaining time (count down) is visible in the footer.

One minute before expiration, a warning message is displayed to the user asking him to renew the session period.
A user can also increment the session at any moment using `Extend session by 1 hour` in the top menu bar.

This field requires a numerical value in **minutes**. Its default value is 60 minutes (1 hour).

### <a name="encrypt-exchanges"></a>Encrypted Client-Server exchanges

Encrypted client-server exchanges option permits to encrypt exchanges between the Client and the Server.
This concerns exchanges (posts and answers) that contain important data such as names, ids, passwords, ...

If your Teampass is not in a safe Network, it is highly recommended to have this option enabled.

----------

### <a name="kb"></a>Knowledge Base 

Knowledge Base is a space where users can create kind of tickets which can contain any kind of information that can be related to existing Items.
The idea behind it is to have a verbose space that comes with the Items.

[Back to Top](#top)

----------

### <a name="suggestion"></a>Item Suggestion

Suggestion is a system permitting any User (and especially the Read-Only ones) to suggest new Items to be added in the list of Items.

### <a name="info"></a>information about Teampass

When opening the `Information` page when logged as an Administrator, some information such as `last Teampass version` are loaded from the Teampass server.

By default this is enabled but you can disable it.
This will not permit you to be warned when a new release is available. 

[Back to Top](#top)

----------

### <a name="failed-edition"></a>Failed item edition

Teampass is a multi-users tool. That means that several users may access an item at the same time. In order to prevent against item edition by several users in parallel, Teampass allocates a token to the 1st user that started the edition. 
This will reject an edition of another user.
When the current editor closes or save the item, the token is deleted.

This option permits to define a duration in **minutes** during which no other edition will be allowed, but when delay is reached, the token will be deleted and current user will not be able to save anymore.
In other words, this permits to ensure that the editor hasnâ€™t forgotten to close the edition.

By default, the value is set to `0`. This disables this feature and only an Administrator can remove the token.
A good value could be 10 minutes as we can assume that no one will modify an item in more than 10 minutes.

----------

### <a name="otv-expiration"></a>One Time View link expiration

One Time View permits a User to share an Item with a person that doesn't have access to Teampass. This person receives an email that contains a link. This link permits to open a specific page in Teampass that contains the Item information.

This link can only be open once as it is deleted once displayed. This option permits to define the number of **days** the link is valid. In other words, once the delay is passed, the link is removed and the person will reached an empty page.

### <a name="managers-edit-delete"></a>Managers can edit and delete items

Managers are normal Users with some more rights on Folders, Groups and Users configuration.
By enabling this option, they will also be allowed to `edit` and `delete` any Items they are allowed to access.

By default, this option is **enabled**. 

[Back to Top](#top)

----------

### <a name="folder-same-name"></a>Folders with identical name

By default, it is not allowed to have 2 Folders with the same name. Nevertheless this restriction can be by-passed by enabling it.

As a result, no control will be performed on Folder names while creating or editing them. And 2 or more folders may have the same name inside Teampass tree structure.

[Back to Top](#top)

----------

### <a name="item-same-name"></a>Items with identical label

By default, it is not allowed to have 2 Items with the same label. Nevertheless this restriction can be by-passed by enabling it.
No control will be performed on Item labels while creating or editing them as long as they are located in different Folders.

As a result, several Items may have the same label while they are located in different Folders. But no duplicate one will be allowed in one Folder.

[Back to Top](#top)

----------

### <a name="similar-items-one-folder"></a>Identical items in Folder

As seen in previous point, similar Items in one Folder is not possible by default in Teampass. By enabling this feature, users may create Items with similar label inside a unique Folder.

[Back to Top](#top)

----------

### <a name="simple-tree"></a>Simplify Tree

The folders Tree is shown as a complete structure. As a consequence, a User (depending on his access rights) may see Folders that he will not be able to access. By clicking on it, a warning message indicating the User that he is not allowed to access the folder will be displayed.

In case of simple Tree structure, it could be useful to enable this option, so that Users only see the Folders they are allowed to access.

But this might generate inconsistencies for the Users in complex Tree structure. Indeed if a User has access to a sub-folder of a folder (to which he is not allowed to access), the Tree structure will not show the top-folder which will give a wrong view of the path to User.
But this is only a view, there is no incidence on the data and contain.

----------

### <a name="folder-rights"></a>New folder rights inheritance

When creating a new Folder, all existing User-Groups who have access to parent-folder will also receive the access rights to this new sub-folder.

*As an example, if parent-folder can be accessed by User-Groups U1 and U3, then those 2 User-Groups will have access to this new sub-folder (respecting the type of access defined).*

By enabling this option, all User-Groups the creator belongs to will also receive the `Write` access on this new sub-folder.

*As an example, if Creator belongs to User-Groups U1, U2 and U4, then all users belonging to those 3 User-Groups will also have Write access on this new sub-folder.*

### <a name="categories"></a>Adding more fields to Items using Categories

It is possible to define custom fields to be added to Items definition. As example, `URL` field is by designed existing in Teampass but for a specific type of Items, it could be requested to have a `Credit Card PIN` field. In this case, it could be interesting to enable this option.

By using the tab `Categories`, it is possible to define Categories of new fields. Each Category is then related to Folders.
By this it is possible to request specific types of fields to be added to the Item Definition.

Notice that **all custom fields inputs are encrypted** in the database.

By default, this option is **disabled**.

Once selected the destination Folder and the file to use, the importation is performed automatically. This means that all Folders and Items existing in the XML file will be created inside the destination Folder.

<span class="fa fa-info"></span>&nbsp;Notice that if Keepass folder structure is composed of several sub-folders with the same name in the same folder, then all Items will be created in one unique sub-folder.

<span class="fa fa-info"></span>&nbsp;In a general manner, it is recommended to keep a reasonable number of Items in on Folder in order to prevent against painful loading time. Teampass has no limit in term of Folders so organize your structure in a smart way.

### <a name="remote-linux-pwd-change"></a>Changing user password on remote Linux server

It has been developed to ensure password synchronization between server user account and Teampass. Meaning that if the Item concerns an Account on a remote Linux server, while changing the the password under Teampass, it can be automatically changed on the server.

Teampass can either do this as:

- **one-shot** - the user decides to update the server account and Teampass performs the change
- **automatic** - based upon a task and a frequency, Teampass automatically changes the password in Teampass and on the server.

<span class="fa fa-info"></span>&nbsp;This requires an SSH connection.
