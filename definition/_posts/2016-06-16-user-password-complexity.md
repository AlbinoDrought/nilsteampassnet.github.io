> Teampass expects Users to use a login password defined with a minimum level of complexity.

# Definition

When a User gets logged for the first time, Teampass requires that he defines a new password that fits a minimum level of complexity.

This level of complexity is defined in the Group definition to which the User belongs.

# How to set the User's password complexity level

This is part of the definition of the Group to which the User belongs.

So to change it, it is required to:

* open the Groups page
* select the Group to be changed
* adapt the complexity level a User Password should at least reached to be accepted 

# In case of several Groups

If the User belongs to several Groups then the most higher complexity level will be required for his password definition.
