> Teampass uses Folders in order to organize the Items.

# Definition

A Folder is a container for Items. The complete set of Folders is the Folders Tree.

# Access rights

Each folder is set up with specific access rights for Users and/or Users Group.

By default, a sub-folder inherits the access rights of its parent.  

# Actions on a Folder

Depending on the User rights, a User may be able to:

* Create a Folder
* Rename a Folder
* Delete a Folder
* Move a Folder

In all cases, this can be performed either by `Managing Folders` page or by `Items` page.

<span class="fa fa-warning"></span>&nbsp;**In case of folder deletion**, all sub-folders and Items will also be deleted.
